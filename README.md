## Blackjack Project

 Week 3 Skill Distillery homework
 
Technologies used:
Enum, polymorphism, inheritance, loops, OOP, abstract classes

Lessons Learned:

Navigation through my classes proved to be the hardest part of this program, along with the new technology enum. Using multiple methods to attack a problem breaks it into multiple little problem but when I needed to change a way of doing things I found myself having to go through each one class to handle the change. Practice makes perfect and this project again strengthen my skills with the enum class and using multi class methods to perform a task. While it was stressful to spend a lot of time to get the basic requirements I still find my self wanting more out of my program and seeing what I can do better the next time and hope to better use the technologies I am getting aquatinted with. Programing for me has continued to not be a source of income but a is truly becoming a passion and enjoyment. I am excited to build future more in depth programs. Enjoy the blackjack game and look for more updates in the future.
